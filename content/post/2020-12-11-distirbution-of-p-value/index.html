<p>We prove that the P-value is uniform distributed under the null hypothesis.</p>
<p>Assume that our test statistic <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> follows an arbitrary distribution with cummulative distribution function <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> under the null hypothesis. For any value <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> of our test statistic, the p-value is computed by calculating the probability of seeing the value <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> or something more extreme under the null hypothesis. The P-value for an observation <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> be defined as <span class="math inline">\(p = F(t) = Prob(T \leq t)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Remark 1: We assumed a one-sided test here, for a two-sided test the argument is essentially the same.</p>
<p>Remark 2: Note that the P-value is a random variable because our test-statistic <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is also a random variable. For example in the t-test our test statistic is a transformation of the sample mean <span class="math inline">\(\bar{X}\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[T=(\bar{X}-\mu)/(\sigma/\sqrt{n})\]</span></p>
<p>So we can define the ranomd vairbale that gives us the P-value as <span class="math inline">\(P=F(T)\)</span>.</p>
<p>It follows that <span class="math display">\[Prob[P \leq p] = Prob[F(T)\leq p] = \]</span> <span class="math display">\[Prob[F^{-1} F(T) \leq F^{-1}(p)] = Prob[T \leq F^{-1} (p) ] = \]</span> <span class="math display">\[F[F^{-1}(p)]= p,\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(F^{-1}\)</span> is the inverse of the CDF (cf. quantiles!). In other words, the CDF of the P value is <span class="math inline">\(F(p) = p\)</span>, which is the CDF of a uniform distribution, more precisly it is the CDF of Uniform(0,1).</p>
