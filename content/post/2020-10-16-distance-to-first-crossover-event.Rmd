We want to calcualte the distribution of the distance to the first crossover event on a long chromosome. We call this distance $X$.

Let $Y$ be the number of recombination events over a length of $d$ centimorgan. This number is Poisson distirbuted with parameter $\lambda = d$. The probability that no crossover occured in this stretch of DNA is then 

$$
P(Y = 0) = e^{-d}.
$$

Note that if $Y = 0$, this means that the distance to the first recombination event must be larger than $d$.
It follows that 

$$P(X > d) = P(Y = 0) = e^{-d}.$$
The CDF of X is therfore 
$$F_X(d) = P(X \leq d) = 1- P(X > d) = 1- e^{-d}.$$

This is the CDF of an exponential distribution with rate 1, whcih is what we wanted to show.
