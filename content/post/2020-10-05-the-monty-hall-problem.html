<p>Here is some R code to illustrate the outcomes of the two strategies (staying and switching) discussed in the lecture. You can copy and paste this code to play around with it.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
## Attaching package: &#39;dplyr&#39;</code></pre>
<pre><code>## The following objects are masked from &#39;package:stats&#39;:
## 
##     filter, lag</code></pre>
<pre><code>## The following objects are masked from &#39;package:base&#39;:
## 
##     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>library(RColorBrewer)
# number of runs
n = 1000
all.doors = 1:3

# some variables to keep track of waht is going on
win.stay = numeric(n)
win.switch = numeric(n)
chosen = numeric(n)
winning = numeric(n)
openend = numeric(n)

for (i in 1 : n)
{
  # chose a winning door for each time
  winning.door = sample(all.doors,1)
  
  # contest chooses a door 
  chosen.door = sample(all.doors,1)
  
  # game host opens one door, 
  # the remaining door is the one that the contest can switch to
  if(winning.door == chosen.door)
  {
    # we randomly chosen one door that is not the winning door 
    # or the chosen door
    # we open the other one
    # the player can switch to the remaining door
    
    remaining.door = sample(all.doors[-winning.door],1)
    
  }
  
  else 
  {
    # we select the door that is not the winning door
    # and not the chosen door and open it
    opened.door = all.doors[-c(winning.door,chosen.door)]
    
    # the remaining door is then the one that is not chosen
    # and not opened
    remaining.door = all.doors[-c(chosen.door,opened.door)]
    
  }

  win.switch[i] = (remaining.door == winning.door)
  win.stay[i] = (chosen.door == winning.door)
  
  # record for visualization
  chosen[i] = chosen.door
  winning[i] = winning.door

}


print(paste(&quot;The strategy &#39;switch&#39; yielded &quot;, sum(win.switch), &quot; wins.&quot;))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;The strategy &#39;switch&#39; yielded  659  wins.&quot;</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>print(paste(&quot;The strategy &#39;stay&#39; yielded &quot;, sum(win.stay), &quot; wins.&quot;))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;The strategy &#39;stay&#39; yielded  341  wins.&quot;</code></pre>
<p>We can visualize the outcome by plotting when and how often each strategy leads to winning the prize.</p>

We see two interesting things: (1) “switch” wins exactly when “stay” doesn’t win and (2) switching always wins if you chose the wrong door initially. Thus, staying wins with a probability of 1/3 (choosing the right door out of 3), and switching wins with a probability of 2/3.</p>
