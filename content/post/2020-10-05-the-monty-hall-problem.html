<p>Here is some R code to illustrate the outcomes of the two strategies (staying and switching) discussed in the lecture. You can copy and paste this code to play around with it.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># number of runs
n = 100
all.doors = 1:3

win.stay = numeric(n)
win.switch = numeric(n)

for (i in 1 : n)
{
  # chose a winning door for each time
  winning.door = sample(all.doors,1)
  
  # contest chooses a door 
  chosen.door = sample(all.doors,1)
  
  # game host opens one door, 
  # the remaining door is the one that the contest can switch to
  if(winning.door == chosen.door)
  {
    # we randomly chosen one door that is not the winning door 
    #Â or the chosen door
    # we open the other one
    # the player can switch to the remaining door
    
    remaining.door = sample(all.doors[-winning.door],1)
    
  }
  
  else 
  {
    # we select the door that is not the winning door
    # and not the chosen door and open it
    opened.door = all.doors[-c(winning.door,chosen.door)]
    
    # the remaining door is then the one that is not chosen
    # and not opened
    remaining.door = all.doors[-c(chosen.door,opened.door)]
    
  }

  win.switch[i] = (remaining.door == winning.door)
  win.stay[i] = (chosen.door == winning.door)

}


print(paste(&quot;The strategy &#39;switch&#39; yielded &quot;, sum(win.switch), &quot; wins.&quot;))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;The strategy &#39;switch&#39; yielded  72  wins.&quot;</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>print(paste(&quot;The strategy &#39;stay&#39; yielded &quot;, sum(win.stay), &quot; wins.&quot;))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;The strategy &#39;stay&#39; yielded  28  wins.&quot;</code></pre>
