<p>Here is some R code to illustrate the outcomes of the two strategies (staying and switching) discussed in the lecture. You can copy and paste this code to play around with it.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># number of runs
n = 100
all.doors = 1:3

# some variables to keep track of waht is going on
win.stay = numeric(n)
win.switch = numeric(n)
chosen = numeric(n)
winning = numeric(n)
openend = numeric(n)

for (i in 1 : n)
{
  # chose a winning door for each time
  winning.door = sample(all.doors,1)
  
  # contest chooses a door 
  chosen.door = sample(all.doors,1)
  
  # game host opens one door, 
  # the remaining door is the one that the contest can switch to
  if(winning.door == chosen.door)
  {
    # we randomly chosen one door that is not the winning door 
    # or the chosen door
    # we open the other one
    # the player can switch to the remaining door
    
    remaining.door = sample(all.doors[-winning.door],1)
    
  }
  
  else 
  {
    # we select the door that is not the winning door
    # and not the chosen door and open it
    opened.door = all.doors[-c(winning.door,chosen.door)]
    
    # the remaining door is then the one that is not chosen
    # and not opened
    remaining.door = all.doors[-c(chosen.door,opened.door)]
    
  }

  win.switch[i] = (remaining.door == winning.door)
  win.stay[i] = (chosen.door == winning.door)
  
  # record for visualization
  chosen[i] = chosen.door
  winning[i] = winning.door

}


print(paste(&quot;The strategy &#39;switch&#39; yielded &quot;, sum(win.switch), &quot; wins.&quot;))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;The strategy &#39;switch&#39; yielded  74  wins.&quot;</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>print(paste(&quot;The strategy &#39;stay&#39; yielded &quot;, sum(win.stay), &quot; wins.&quot;))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;The strategy &#39;stay&#39; yielded  26  wins.&quot;</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>dat = data.frame(switch = win.switch,stay = win.stay,chosen = chosen,winning = winning)</code></pre>
<p>Note that the sum of switch or stay strategy winning sums to 100. As we have discussed in the lecture, “switch” wins exactly when “stay” doesn’t win. And since staying wins with a probability of 1/3 (choosing the right door out of 3), we can conclude that switching must win with a probability of 2/3. Our simulation confirms this.</p>
