<p>We want to calcualte the distribution of the distance to the first crossover event on a long chromosome. We call this distance <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> be the number of recombination events over a length of <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> centimorgan. This number is Poisson distirbuted with parameter <span class="math inline">\(\lambda = d\)</span>. The probability that no crossover occured in this stretch of DNA is then</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
P(Y = 0) = e^{-d}.
\]</span></p>
<p>Note that if <span class="math inline">\(Y = 0\)</span>, this means that the distance to the first recombination event must be larger than <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>. It follows that</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(X &gt; d) = P(Y = 0) = e^{-d}.\]</span> The CDF of X is therfore <span class="math display">\[F_X(d) = P(X \leq d) = 1- P(X &gt; d) = 1- e^{-d}.\]</span></p>
<p>This is the CDF of an exponential distribution with rate 1, whcih is what we wanted to show.</p>
