<p>We introduce the binomial distribution with a simple example: imagine you have a coin with two sides: Heads and Tails. We don’t know if the coin is fair, but we can try to do an experiment to see if it s fair. We flip it many times and if it is a fair coin, we should see the same number of Heads and Tails. Let’s say we have flipped it 10 times and got the following sequence: s = {H,T,T,T,H,H,T,H,T,T}. What is the probability for this particular outcome if it is a fair coin? Since all coin tosses are independent, we get:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
P(Sequence = s) = (1/2)^{10}. 
\]</span>
W observe that each outcome would be equally likely, because the probability for Heads or Tails are the same: <span class="math inline">\(1/2\)</span>. Clearly this is not very helpful. So let us try something else: we count the number of Heads (calling it a success - the choice that Heads is a success is arbitrary and doesn’t matter). In our example the number of heads is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[H = 4.\]</span></p>
<p>What is the probability for observing 4 Heads in 10 coin flips? This muse be something different than the probability calculate above for one specific sequence, because there are many ways to get 4 Heads. For instance {H,H,H,H,T,T,T,T,T,T} has 4 heads, and so does {H,T,H,T,H,T,H,T,T,T}. Both of these outcomes are equally likely and both of them yield 4 heads.</p>
<p>A next question that naturally arises is whether the probabilities for H = 0, H = 1, etc. are different from each other. Intuitvely one would think so. Let us try to calculate this:</p>
<ul>
<li>H = 0</li>
</ul>
<p>There is only one way to get this outcome, so the probability for this sequence of all Tails is equal to the probability for H = 0:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(H = 0) = (1/2)^{10}.\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li>H = 1</li>
</ul>
<p>For H = 1, there are 10 possible sequences; the first coin toss is H but all other T, or the second one is H and all other T, or the third one H and all other T, and so on. Thus the probability for H = 1 is
<span class="math display">\[P(H = 1) = 10*(1/2)^{10},\]</span>
because these sequences correspond to disjoint events and we can simply add them up.</p>
<ul>
<li>H = k, where k = 0, …, n</li>
</ul>
<p>From now on it gets more complex and we do not need to go through all cases separately. Instead we use a result from combinatorics to solve the general case. We need to calculate the number of ways how we can choose k elements out of n, where k is the number of H tosses and n is the total number of tosses. This is given by the so called binomial coefficient:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{n\choose k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}, \]</span> with
<span class="math display">\[n! = 1*2*3*...*(n-1)*n.\]</span></p>
<p>If we now out all this together, we have derived the binomial distribution for the case of <span class="math inline">\(\pi = 1/2\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
P( H = k) = {n\choose k} (1/2)^n
\]</span></p>
<p>The last step is to consider the general case where <span class="math inline">\(0 &lt; \pi &lt; 1\)</span>, so that the probability for a success is equal to <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>. Then the probability for any sequence with k successes and n-k failures is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\pi^k (1-\pi)^{n-k}\]</span></p>
<p>and since there are <span class="math inline">\({n\choose k}\)</span> such sequences the probability for k successes among n trials is:
<span class="math display">\[P(H = k) = {n\choose k} \pi^k (1-\pi)^{n-k}\]</span></p>
<p>In R we can get this distribution very easily in the following way:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(ggplot2)
# plot the distribution

pi = 0.5
n = 10
k = 0:10

bin.dist = dbinom(k,n,pi)

dat = data.frame(k = k,dist = bin.dist)

ggplot(dat,aes(x = k,y= dist)) + 
  geom_point() +
  theme_classic() + 
  theme(text = element_text(size = 20)) </code></pre>

<p>If we want to draw a random sample from a distribution, we can also do this in R:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pi = 0.5
n = 10
k = 0:10

random.sample = rbinom(1,n,pi)
print(random.sample)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 5</code></pre>
