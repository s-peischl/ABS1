      <description>We introduce the binomial distribution with a simple example: imagine you have a coin with two sides: Heads and Tails. We don’t know if the coin is fair, but we can try to do an experiment to see if it s fair. We flip it many times and if it is a fair coin, we should see the same number of Heads and Tails. Let’s say we have flipped it 10 times and got the following sequence: s = {H,T,T,T,H,H,T,H,T,T}.</description>

      <description>Here is some R code to illustrate the outcomes of the two strategies (staying and switching) discussed in the lecture. You can copy and paste this code to play around with it.
library(ggplot2) library(dplyr) ## ## Attaching package: &amp;#39;dplyr&amp;#39; ## The following objects are masked from &amp;#39;package:stats&amp;#39;: ## ## filter, lag ## The following objects are masked from &amp;#39;package:base&amp;#39;: ## ## intersect, setdiff, setequal, union library(RColorBrewer) # number of runs n = 1000 all.</description>

      <title>Bayes Theorem and Conditional Probability</title>

      <description>Consider a medical test for a rare disease. The test is quite accurate: it detects the disease with 95% probability (sensitivity of the test), and indicates the absence of the disease with 90% probability ( specificity of the test).
Notation:
 event D: person has the disease; event T: test is positive (i.e., indicates disease)  We assume that the disease has incidence of 1 %: P[D] = 0.01.</description>

      <title>Exercises</title>
      <link>/ABS1/2020/08/31/the-exercise-sessions/</link>

      <description>The exercises will be held on Thursday morning for the Bioinformatics Master Students and Friday morning for the Ecology and Evolution master students. In principle, students can choose freely which session they want to addend, but this needs to be decided in the first week of the semester!
You will get an exercise series with a list of (mostly) applied problems. The teaching assistants will schedule presentations of the exercises in the first exercise session.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the webpage for the course Applied Biostatistics 1. Due to current developments we are offering this course as online only. The reason for this decision is simply that this will allow us to offer high quality lectures for everyone in a unified system. A mixture of live lectures and online podcasts would be complicated to organize (we would need to limit and track the students who attend the lectures, record the lectures and exercises sessions, eventually switch the whole system in case there is a confirmed Covid19 case in our lecture, etc.</description>
