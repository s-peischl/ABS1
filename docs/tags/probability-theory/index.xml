      <description>We want to calcualte the distribution of the distance to the first crossover event on a long chromosome. We call this distance \(X\).
Let \(Y\) be the number of recombination events over a length of \(d\) centimorgan. This number is Poisson distirbuted with parameter \(\lambda = d\). The probability that no crossover occured in this stretch of DNA is then
\[ P(Y = 0) = e^{-d}. \]
Note that if \(Y = 0\), this means that the distance to the first recombination event must be larger than \(d\).</description>

      <description>We introduce the binomial distribution with a simple example: imagine you have a coin with two sides: Heads and Tails. We don&#39;t know if the coin is fair, but we can try to do an experiment to see if it s fair. We flip it many times and if it is a fair coin, we should see the same number of Heads and Tails. Let&#39;s say we have flipped it 10 times and got the following sequence: s = {H,T,T,T,H,H,T,H,T,T}.</description>

      <description>I discuss a solution to the Monty Hall Problem discussed in the lecture. There are many ways to think of this problem and a thorugh discussion can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem.
Game Rules:
Pick a door. One door has a prize behind it, say a car, the other two contain just &amp;quot;goats&amp;quot;. (Some people might prefer a goat over a car, me included. I just stick with the original formulation here, so let&#39;s just say the goat is a symbol for not getting anything and the car a symbol for a prize we actually like to have).</description>
