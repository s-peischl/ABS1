      <description>The exercises will be held on Thursday morning for the Bioinformatics Master Students and Friday morning for the Ecology and Evolution master students. In principle, students can choose freely which session they want to addend, but this needs to be decided in the first week of the semester!
You will get an exercise series with a list of (mostly) applied problems. The teaching assistants will schedule presentations of the exercises in the first exercise session.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the webpage for the course Applied Biostatistics 1. Due to current developments we are offering this course as online only. The reason for this decision is simply that this will allow us to offer high quality lectures for everyone in a unified system. A mixture of live lectures and online podcasts would be complicated to organize (we would need to limit and track the students who attend the lectures, record the lectures and exercises sessions, eventually switch the whole system in case there is a confirmed Covid19 case in our lecture, etc.</description>
