      <description>The exercises will be held on Thursday morning for the Bioinformatics Master Students and Friday morning for the Ecology and Evolution master students. In principle, students can choose freely which session they want to addend, but this needs to be decided in the first week of the semester!
You will get an exercise series with a list of (mostly) applied problems. The teaching assistants will schedule presentations of the exercises in the first exercise session.</description>
