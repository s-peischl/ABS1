      <description>We introduce the binomial distribution with a simple example: imagine you have a coin with two sides: Heads and Tails. We don’t know if the coin is fair, but we can try to do an experiment to see if it s fair. We flip it many times and if it is a fair coin, we should see the same number of Heads and Tails. Let’s say we have flipped it 10 times and got the following sequence: s = {H,T,T,T,H,H,T,H,T,T}.</description>

      <description>I discuss a solution to the Monty Hall Problem discussed in the lecture. There are many ways to think of this problem and a thorugh discussion can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem.
Game Rules:
Pick a door. One door has a prize behind it, say a car, the other two contain just &amp;quot;goats&amp;quot;. (Some people might prefer a goat over a car, me included. I just stick with the original formulation here, so let&#39;s just say the goat is a symbol for not getting anything and the car a symbol for a prize we actually like to have).</description>
